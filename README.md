# CV-Application

Project deployed through Netifly-https://sunny-bienenstitch-bdfd4f.netlify.app/ 

My first project built using React. The goal of the project was to split the CV into different components and to also implement the previous lessons arount state. Each section contains an edit/submit button that allows the user to modify the current information in the input boxes which is then mirrored on the main body of the CV.
